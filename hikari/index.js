Other Parameters         allow_color : builtins.bool Defaulting to  builtins.True , this will enable coloured console logs on any platform that is a TTY. Setting a  \"CLICOLOR\" environment variable to any  non  0 value will override this setting. Users should consider this an advice to the application on whether it is safe to show colours if possible or not. Since some terminals can be awkward or not support features in a standard way, the option to explicitly disable this is provided. See  force_color for an alternative. banner : typing.Optional[builtins.str] The package to search for a  banner.txt in. Defaults to  \"hikari\" for the  \"hikari/banner.txt\" banner. Setting this to  builtins.None will disable the banner being shown. chunking_limit : typing.Optional[builtins.int] Defaults to  200 . The maximum amount of requests that this chunker should store information about for each shard. enable_cache : builtins.bool Defaults to  builtins.True . If  builtins.False , the application is configured to be mostly stateless. This means almost all cache calls will yield an empty or  builtins.None value, and you will be left to rely on the  REST API only. This can be a viable alternative if you are providing a custom cache implementation, or simply do not want the overhead of maintaining a state in your application. executor : typing.Optional[concurrent.futures.Executor] Defaults to  builtins.None . If non- builtins.None , then this executor is used instead of the  concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor attached to the  asyncio.AbstractEventLoop that the bot will run on. This executor is used primarily for file-IO. While mainly supporting the  concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor implementation in the standard lib, Hikari's file handling systems should also work with  concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor , which relies on all objects used in IPC to be  pickle able. Many third-party libraries will not support this fully though, so your mileage may vary on using ProcessPoolExecutor implementations with this parameter. force_color : builtins.bool Defaults to  builtins.False . If  builtins.True , then this application will __force__ colour to be used in console-based output. Specifying a  \"CLICOLOR_FORCE\" environment variable with a non- \"0\" value will override this setting. http_settings : typing.Optional[hikari.config.HTTPSettings] Optional custom HTTP configuration settings to use. Allows you to customise functionality such as whether SSL-verification is enabled, what timeouts  aiohttp should expect to use for requests, and behavior regarding HTTP-redirects. intents : typing.Optional[hikari.intents.Intents] Defaults to  hikari.intents.Intents.ALL_UNPRIVILEGED . This allows you to change which intents your application will use on the gateway. This can be used to control and change the types of events you will receive. You can set this to  builtins.None to explicitly disable intents. You will need to enable privileged intents to continue receiving events pertaining to members and member presences from the 7th October 2020. Note that explicitly disabling intents should be treated as deprecated behaviour, and is only supported until Hikari is moved to the v8 Discord API, where this will become mandatory. logs : typing.Union[builtins.None, LoggerLevel, typing.Dict[str, typing.Any Defaults to  \"INFO\" . If  builtins.None , then the Python logging system is left uninitialized on startup, and you will need to configure it manually to view most logs that are output by components of this library. If one of the valid values in a  LoggerLevel , then this will match a call to  colorlog.basicConfig (a facade for  logging.basicConfig with additional conduit for enabling coloured logging levels) with the  level kwarg matching this value. If a  typing.Dict[str, typing.Any] equivalent, then this value is passed to  logging.config.dictConfig to allow the user to provide a specialized logging configuration of their choice. As a side note, you can always opt to leave this on the default value and then use an incremental  logging.config.dictConfig that applies any additional changes on top of the base configuration, if you prefer. An example of this is as follows:  py import os from logging.config import dictConfig from hikari import Bot, Intents bot = Bot(token=os.environ[\"BOT_TOKEN\"], intents=Intents.ALL, logs=\"INFO\")  We want to make gateway logs output as DEBUG, and TRACE for all ratelimit content. dictConfig({ \"version\": 1, \"incremental\": True, \"loggers\": { \"hikari.gateway\": { \"level\": \"DEBUG\" }, \"hikari.ratelimits\": { \"level\": \"TRACE_HIKARI\" }, }, })  Taking note that  \"TRACE_HIKARI\" is a library-specific logging level which is expected to be more verbose than  \"DEBUG\" . proxy_settings : typing.Optional[config.ProxySettings] If specified, custom proxy settings to use with network-layer logic in your application to get through an HTTP-proxy. rest_url : typing.Optional[builtins.str] Defaults to the Discord REST API URL if  builtins.None . Can be overridden if you are attempting to point to an unofficial endpoint, or if you are attempting to mock/stub the Discord API for any reason. Generally you do not want to change this.  ! note  force_color will always take precedence over  allow_color .  ! note Settings that control the gateway session are provided to the  BotApp.run and  BotApp.start functions in this class. This is done to allow you to contextually customise details such as sharding configuration without having to re-initialize the entire application each time."

Other Parameters         activity : typing.Optional[hikari.presences.Activity] The initial activity to display in the bot user presence, or  builtins.None (default) to not show any. afk : builtins.bool The initial AFK state to display in the bot user presence, or  builtins.False (default) to not show any. asyncio_debug : builtins.bool Defaults to  builtins.False . If  builtins.True , then debugging is enabled for the asyncio event loop in use. check_for_updates : builtins.bool Defaults to  builtins.True . If  builtins.True , will check for newer versions of  hikari on PyPI and notify if available. close_passed_executor : builtins.bool Defaults to  builtins.False . If  builtins.True , any custom  concurrent.futures.Executor passed to the constructor will be shut down when the application terminates. This does not affect the default executor associated with the event loop, and will not do anything if you do not provide a custom executor to the constructor. close_loop : builtins.bool Defaults to  builtins.True . If  builtins.True , then once the bot enters a state where all components have shut down permanently during application shutdown, then all asyngens and background tasks will be destroyed, and the event loop will be shut down. This will wait until all  hikari -owned  aiohttp connectors have had time to attempt to shut down correctly (around 250ms), and on Python 3.9 and newer, will also shut down the default event loop executor too. coroutine_tracking_depth : typing.Optional[builtins.int] Defaults to  builtins.None . If an integer value and supported by the interpreter, then this many nested coroutine calls will be tracked with their call origin state. This allows you to determine where non-awaited coroutines may originate from, but generally you do not want to leave this enabled for performance reasons. enable_signal_handlers : builtins.bool Defaults to  builtins.True . If on a __non-Windows__ OS with builtin support for kernel-level POSIX signals, then setting this to  builtins.True will allow treating keyboard interrupts and other OS signals to safely shut down the application as calls to shut down the application properly rather than just killing the process in a dirty state immediately. You should leave this disabled unless you plan to implement your own signal handling yourself. idle_since : typing.Optional[datetime.datetime] The  datetime.datetime the user should be marked as being idle since, or  builtins.None (default) to not show this. ignore_session_start_limit : builtins.bool Defaults to  builtins.False . If  builtins.False , then attempting to start more sessions than you are allowed in a 24 hour window will throw a  hikari.errors.GatewayError rather than going ahead and hitting the IDENTIFY limit, which may result in your token being reset. Setting to  builtins.True disables this behavior. large_threshold : builtins.int Threshold for members in a guild before it is treated as being \"large\" and no longer sending member details in the  GUILD CREATE event. Defaults to  250 . propagate_interrupts : builtins.bool Defaults to  builtins.False . If set to  builtins.True , then any internal  hikari.errors.HikariInterrupt that is raises as a result of catching an OS level signal will result in the exception being rethrown once the application has closed. This can allow you to use hikari signal handlers and still be able to determine what kind of interrupt the application received after it closes. When  builtins.False , nothing is raised and the call will terminate cleanly and silently where possible instead. shard_ids : typing.Optional[typing.Set[builtins.int The shard IDs to create shards for. If not  builtins.None , then a non- None  shard_count must ALSO be provided. Defaults to  builtins.None , which means the Discord-recommended count is used for your application instead. shard_count : typing.Optional[builtins.int] The number of shards to use in the entire distributed application.

The purpose of this is to provide an interface to lazily deserialize collections of payloads received from paginated API endpoints such as  GET /channels/{channel_id}/messages , which will return a certain number of messages at a time on a low level. This class provides the base interface for handling lazily decoding each item in those responses and returning them in the expected format when iterating across this object. Implementations are expected to provide a  _next_chunk private method which when awaited returns a lazy generator of each deserialized object to later yield. This will be iterated across lazily by this implementation, thus reducing the amount of work needed if only a few objects out of, say, 100, need to be deserialized. This  _next_chunk should return  builtins.None once the end of all items has been reached. An example would look like the following:   async def some_http_call(i):  . class SomeEndpointLazyIterator(BufferedLazyIterator[SomeObject]): def __init__(self): super().__init__() self._i = 0 def _next_chunk(self) -> typing.Optional[typing.Generator[ValueT, None, None : raw_items = await some_http_call(self._i) self._i += 1 if not raw_items: return None generator = (SomeObject(raw_item) for raw_item in raw_items) return generator  "

Returns    - typing.Optional[datetime.datetime] The timestamp set on the embed.  ! warning Setting a non-timezone-aware datetime will result in a warning being raised. This is done due to potential confusion caused by Discord requiring a UTC timestamp for this field. Any non-timezone aware timestamp is interpreted as using the system's current timezone instead. Thus, using  datetime.datetime.utcnow will result in a potentially incorrect timezone being set. To generate a timezone aware timestamp, use one of the following snippets:  Use UTC. >>> datetime.datetime.now(tz=datetime.timezone.utc) datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 5, 18, 29, 56, 424744, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)  Use your current timezone. >>> datetime.datetime.now().astimezone() datetime.datetime(2020, 7, 7, 8, 57, 9, 775328, tzinfo= ., 'BST' By specifying a timezone, Hikari can automatically adjust the given time to UTC without you needing to think about it. You can generate a timezone-aware timestamp instead of a timezone-naive one by specifying a timezone. Hikari will detect any difference in timezone if the timestamp is non timezone-naive and fix it for you.  I am British, and it is June, so we are in daylight saving  (UTC+1 or GMT+1, specifically). >>> import datetime  This is timezone naive, notice no timezone in the repr that  gets printed. This is no good to us, as Discord will interpret it  as being in the future! >>> datetime.datetime.now() datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 5, 19, 29, 48, 281716)  Instead, this is a timezone-aware timestamp, and we can use this  correctly. This will always return the current time in UTC. >>> datetime.datetime.now(tz=datetime.timezone.utc) datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 5, 18, 29, 56, 424744, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)  We could instead use a custom timezone. Since the timezone is  explicitly specified, Hikari will convert it to UTC for you when  you send the embed. >>>  . A library on PyPI called [tzlocal]( .) also exists that may be useful to you if you need to get your local timezone for any reason. >>> import datetime >>> import tzlocal  Naive datetime that will show the wrong time on Discord. >>> datetime.datetime.now() datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 5, 19, 33, 21, 329950)  Timezone-aware datetime that uses my local timezone correctly. >>> datetime.datetime.now(tz=tzlocal.get_localzone( datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 5, 19, 33, 40, 967939, tzinfo= )  Changing timezones. >>> dt = datetime.datetime.now(tz=datetime.timezone.utc) >>> print(dt) datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 5, 18, 38, 27, 863990, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc) >>> dt.astimezone(tzlocal.get_localzone( datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 5, 19, 38, 27, 863990, tzinfo= )  .this is not required, but you may find it more useful if using the timestamps in debug logs, for example."

Any events not in an intent category will be fired regardless of what intents you provide.  ! info Discord now places limits on certain events you can receive without whitelisting your bot first. On the  Bot tab in the developer's portal for your bot, you should now have the option to enable functionality for receiving these events. If you attempt to request an intent type that you have not whitelisted your bot for, you will be disconnected on startup with a  4014 closure code.  ! warning If you are using the V7 Gateway, you will be REQUIRED to provide some form of intent value when you connect. Failure to do so may result in immediate termination of the session server-side. This enum is an  enum.IntFlag , which means that you can use bitwise operators to join and splice multiple intents into one value. For example, if we wish to only refer to the  GUILDS intent, then it is simply a case of accessing it normally.   my_intents = Intents.GUILDS   If we wanted to have several intents grouped together, we would use the bitwise-or operator to combine them ( | ). This can be done in-place with the  |= operator if needed.    One or two values that fit on one line. my_intents = Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES | Intents.PRIVATE_MESSAGES  Several intents together. You may find it useful to format these like  so to keep your code readable. my_intents = ( Intents.GUILDS | Intents.GUILD_BANS | Intents.GUILD_EMOJIS | Intents.GUILD_INTEGRATIONS | Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES | Intents.PRIVATE_MESSAGES )   To check if an intent  is present in a given intents bitfield, you can use the bitwise-and operator ( & ) to check. This returns the \"intersection\" or \"crossover\" between the left and right-hand side of the  & . You can then use the    operator to check that specific values are present. You can check in-place with the  &= operator if needed.    Check if an intent is set: if (my_intents & Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES)  Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES: print(\"Guild messages are enabled\")  Checking if ALL in a combination are set: expected_intents = (Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES | Intents.PRIVATE_MESSAGES) if (my_intents & expected_intents)  expected_intents: print(\"Messages are enabled in guilds and private messages.\")  Checking if AT LEAST ONE in a combination is set: expected_intents = (Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES | Intents.PRIVATE_MESSAGES) if my_intents & expected_intents: print(\"Messages are enabled in guilds or private messages.\")   Removing one or more intents from a combination can be done with the bitwise-xor ( ^ ) operator. The  ^= operator can do this in-place.    Remove GUILD_MESSAGES my_intents = my_intents ^ Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES  or, simplifying: my_intents ^= Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES  Remove all messages events. my_intents = my_intents ^ (Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES | Intents.PRIVATE_MESSAGES)  or, simplifying my_intents ^= (Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES | Intents.PRIVATE_MESSAGES)   What is and is not covered by intents?                    The following unprivileged events require intents to be dispatched: -  GUILD_CREATE -  GUILD_UPDATE -  GUILD_DELETE -  GUILD_ROLE_CREATE -  GUILD_ROLE_UPDATE -  GUILD_ROLE_DELETE -  GUILD_BAN_ADD -  GUILD_BAN_REMOVE -  GUILD_EMOJIS_UPDATE -  GUILD_INTEGRATIONS_UPDATE -  INVITE_CREATE -  INVITE_DELETE -  CHANNEL_CREATE -  CHANNEL_UPDATE -  CHANNEL_DELETE -  CHANNEL_PINS_UPDATE (guilds only) -  MESSAGE_CREATE -  MESSAGE_UPDATE -  MESSAGE_DELETE -  MESSAGE_BULK_DELETE -  MESSAGE_REACTION_ADD -  MESSAGE_REACTION_REMOVE -  MESSAGE_REACTION_REMOVE_ALL -  MESSAGE_REACTION_REMOVE_EMOJI -  TYPING_START -  VOICE_STATE_UPDATE -  WEBHOOKS_UPDATE The following privileged events require intents to be dispatched: -  GUILD_MEMBER_ADD -  GUILD_MEMBER_UPDATE -  GUILD_MEMBER_REMOVE -  PRESENCE_UPDATE All events not listed above will be dispatched regardless of whether intents are used or not. This flag type has several additional operations that can be used compared to normal enum types. These are applied to instances of this enum directly, or can be used as a class method by passing the flag as the first parameter. -  def split() -> typing.Sequence[Intents]:  .  Will split the combined flag up into individual atomic flags and return them in a  typing.Sequence .   >>> (FOO | BAR | BAZ).split() [FOO, BAR, BAZ]   -  def has_any( flags: Intents) -> bool:  .  Returns  builtins.True if any of the given flags are present in the combined flag this is applied to. Otherwise, returns  builtins.False instead. -  def has_all( flags: Intents) -> bool:  .  Returns  builtins.True if all of the given flags are present in the combined flag this is applied to. Otherwise, returns  builtins.False instead. -  def has_none( flags: Intents) -> bool:  .  Returns  builtins.True if none of the given flags are present in the combined flag this is applied to. Otherwise, returns  builtins.False instead. In addition, new operators are overloaded.  + will combine flags in the same way  | would usually, and  - will remove specific flags from this instance. This is equivalent to using the  & operator. Finally, combined flag types can be iterated across as if they were a collection.   >>> for f in FOO | BAR | BAZ:  . print(f) FOO BAR BAZ  "

This will return the int-value of the permission if it is present, or  0 if not present. my_perms = Permissions.MANAGE_CHANNELS | Permissions.MANAGE_GUILD if my_perms & Permissions.MANAGE_CHANNELS: if my_perms & Permissions.MANAGE_GUILD: print(\"I have the permission to both manage the guild and the channels in it!\") else: print(\"I have the permission to manage channels!\") else: print(\"I don't have the permission to manage channels!\")  Or you could simplify it: if my_perms & (Permissions.MANAGE_CHANNELS | Permissions.MANAGE_GUILD): print(\"I have the permission to both manage the guild and the channels in it!\") elif my_perms & Permissions.MANAGE_CHANNELS: print(\"I have the permission to manage channels!\") else: print(\"I don't have the permission to manage channels!\") If you need to  check that a permission is not present , you can use the bitwise-XOR operator ( ^ ) to check. If the permission is not present, it will return a non-zero value, otherwise if it is present, it will return  0 . my_perms = Permissions.MANAGE_CHANNELS | Permissions.MANAGE_GUILD if my_perms ^ Permissions.MANAGE_CHANNELS: print(\"Please give me the MANAGE_CHANNELS permission!\") Lastly, if you need all the permissions set except the permission you want, you can use the inversion operator ( ~ ) to do that.  All permissions except ADMINISTRATOR. my_perms = ~Permissions.ADMINISTRATOR This flag type has several additional operations that can be used compared to normal enum types. These are applied to instances of this enum directly, or can be used as a class method by passing the flag as the first parameter. -  def split() -> typing.Sequence[Permissions]:  .  Will split the combined flag up into individual atomic flags and return them in a  typing.Sequence .   >>> (FOO | BAR | BAZ).split() [FOO, BAR, BAZ]   -  def has_any( flags: Permissions) -> bool:  .  Returns  builtins.True if any of the given flags are present in the combined flag this is applied to. Otherwise, returns  builtins.False instead. -  def has_all( flags: Permissions) -> bool:  .  Returns  builtins.True if all of the given flags are present in the combined flag this is applied to. Otherwise, returns  builtins.False instead. -  def has_none( flags: Permissions) -> bool:  .  Returns  builtins.True if none of the given flags are present in the combined flag this is applied to. Otherwise, returns  builtins.False instead. In addition, new operators are overloaded.  + will combine flags in the same way  | would usually, and  - will remove specific flags from this instance. This is equivalent to using the  & operator. Finally, combined flag types can be iterated across as if they were a collection.   >>> for f in FOO | BAR | BAZ:  . print(f) FOO BAR BAZ  "

Returns    - typing.Optional[datetime.datetime] The timestamp set on the embed.  ! warning Setting a non-timezone-aware datetime will result in a warning being raised. This is done due to potential confusion caused by Discord requiring a UTC timestamp for this field. Any non-timezone aware timestamp is interpreted as using the system's current timezone instead. Thus, using  datetime.datetime.utcnow will result in a potentially incorrect timezone being set. To generate a timezone aware timestamp, use one of the following snippets:  Use UTC. >>> datetime.datetime.now(tz=datetime.timezone.utc) datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 5, 18, 29, 56, 424744, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)  Use your current timezone. >>> datetime.datetime.now().astimezone() datetime.datetime(2020, 7, 7, 8, 57, 9, 775328, tzinfo= ., 'BST' By specifying a timezone, Hikari can automatically adjust the given time to UTC without you needing to think about it. You can generate a timezone-aware timestamp instead of a timezone-naive one by specifying a timezone. Hikari will detect any difference in timezone if the timestamp is non timezone-naive and fix it for you.  I am British, and it is June, so we are in daylight saving  (UTC+1 or GMT+1, specifically). >>> import datetime  This is timezone naive, notice no timezone in the repr that  gets printed. This is no good to us, as Discord will interpret it  as being in the future! >>> datetime.datetime.now() datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 5, 19, 29, 48, 281716)  Instead, this is a timezone-aware timestamp, and we can use this  correctly. This will always return the current time in UTC. >>> datetime.datetime.now(tz=datetime.timezone.utc) datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 5, 18, 29, 56, 424744, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)  We could instead use a custom timezone. Since the timezone is  explicitly specified, Hikari will convert it to UTC for you when  you send the embed. >>>  . A library on PyPI called [tzlocal]( .) also exists that may be useful to you if you need to get your local timezone for any reason. >>> import datetime >>> import tzlocal  Naive datetime that will show the wrong time on Discord. >>> datetime.datetime.now() datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 5, 19, 33, 21, 329950)  Timezone-aware datetime that uses my local timezone correctly. >>> datetime.datetime.now(tz=tzlocal.get_localzone( datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 5, 19, 33, 40, 967939, tzinfo= )  Changing timezones. >>> dt = datetime.datetime.now(tz=datetime.timezone.utc) >>> print(dt) datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 5, 18, 38, 27, 863990, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc) >>> dt.astimezone(tzlocal.get_localzone( datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 5, 19, 38, 27, 863990, tzinfo= )  .this is not required, but you may find it more useful if using the timestamps in debug logs, for example."

In addition, new operators are overloaded.  + will combine flags in the same way  | would usually, and  - will remove specific flags from this instance. This is equivalent to using the  & operator. Finally, combined flag types can be iterated across as if they were a collection.   >>> for f in FOO | BAR | BAZ:  . print(f) FOO BAR BAZ  "

HikariSPEL (Hikari SimPle Expression Language) is a super-simple expression language used in this module for quickly mapping values to other values and producing streams of changes. This somewhat mirrors other programming languages like Java which have a proper Stream API. The concept of HikariSPEL is that you are trying to look at the attribute of something. So, running  \"bar.baz.bork\" against an object  foo would be equivalent to  foo.bar.baz.bork in pure Python. The reason for doing this is Python lambdas are clunky, and using a nested function is nasty boilerplate. For applying  \"bar.baz\" to  foo , we assume  bar is an attribute or property of  foo , and  baz is an attribute or property of  foo.bar . We may instead want to invoke a method that takes no parameters (looking at  str.islower , as an example. To do this, we append  () onto the attribute name. For example, applying  author.username.islower() to a  hikari.messages.Message object. All expressions may start with a  . . You can negate the whole expression by instead starting them with  !. . You may also want to negate a condition. To do this, prepend  ! to the attribute name. For example, to check if a message was not made by a bot, you could run  author.!is_bot on a  Message object. Likewise, to check if the input was not a number, you could run  content.!isdigit() . This expression language is highly experimental and may change without prior notice for the time being while I play with getting something usable and nice to work with."

"doc":"Represents an intent on the gateway. This is a bitfield representation of all the categories of event that you wish to receive. Any events not in an intent category will be fired regardless of what intents you provide.  ! info Discord now places limits on certain events you can receive without whitelisting your bot first. On the  Bot tab in the developer's portal for your bot, you should now have the option to enable functionality for receiving these events. If you attempt to request an intent type that you have not whitelisted your bot for, you will be disconnected on startup with a  4014 closure code.  ! warning If you are using the V7 Gateway, you will be REQUIRED to provide some form of intent value when you connect. Failure to do so may result in immediate termination of the session server-side. This enum is an  enum.IntFlag , which means that you can use bitwise operators to join and splice multiple intents into one value. For example, if we wish to only refer to the  GUILDS intent, then it is simply a case of accessing it normally.   my_intents = Intents.GUILDS   If we wanted to have several intents grouped together, we would use the bitwise-or operator to combine them ( | ). This can be done in-place with the  |= operator if needed.    One or two values that fit on one line. my_intents = Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES | Intents.PRIVATE_MESSAGES  Several intents together. You may find it useful to format these like  so to keep your code readable. my_intents = ( Intents.GUILDS | Intents.GUILD_BANS | Intents.GUILD_EMOJIS | Intents.GUILD_INTEGRATIONS | Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES | Intents.PRIVATE_MESSAGES )   To check if an intent  is present in a given intents bitfield, you can use the bitwise-and operator ( & ) to check. This returns the \"intersection\" or \"crossover\" between the left and right-hand side of the  & . You can then use the    operator to check that specific values are present. You can check in-place with the  &= operator if needed.    Check if an intent is set: if (my_intents & Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES)  Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES: print(\"Guild messages are enabled\")  Checking if ALL in a combination are set: expected_intents = (Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES | Intents.PRIVATE_MESSAGES) if (my_intents & expected_intents)  expected_intents: print(\"Messages are enabled in guilds and private messages.\")  Checking if AT LEAST ONE in a combination is set: expected_intents = (Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES | Intents.PRIVATE_MESSAGES) if my_intents & expected_intents: print(\"Messages are enabled in guilds or private messages.\")   Removing one or more intents from a combination can be done with the bitwise-xor ( ^ ) operator. The  ^= operator can do this in-place.    Remove GUILD_MESSAGES my_intents = my_intents ^ Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES  or, simplifying: my_intents ^= Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES  Remove all messages events. my_intents = my_intents ^ (Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES | Intents.PRIVATE_MESSAGES)  or, simplifying my_intents ^= (Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES | Intents.PRIVATE_MESSAGES)   What is and is not covered by intents?                    The following unprivileged events require intents to be dispatched: -  GUILD_CREATE -  GUILD_UPDATE -  GUILD_DELETE -  GUILD_ROLE_CREATE -  GUILD_ROLE_UPDATE -  GUILD_ROLE_DELETE -  GUILD_BAN_ADD -  GUILD_BAN_REMOVE -  GUILD_EMOJIS_UPDATE -  GUILD_INTEGRATIONS_UPDATE -  INVITE_CREATE -  INVITE_DELETE -  CHANNEL_CREATE -  CHANNEL_UPDATE -  CHANNEL_DELETE -  CHANNEL_PINS_UPDATE (guilds only) -  MESSAGE_CREATE -  MESSAGE_UPDATE -  MESSAGE_DELETE -  MESSAGE_BULK_DELETE -  MESSAGE_REACTION_ADD -  MESSAGE_REACTION_REMOVE -  MESSAGE_REACTION_REMOVE_ALL -  MESSAGE_REACTION_REMOVE_EMOJI -  TYPING_START -  VOICE_STATE_UPDATE -  WEBHOOKS_UPDATE The following privileged events require intents to be dispatched: -  GUILD_MEMBER_ADD -  GUILD_MEMBER_UPDATE -  GUILD_MEMBER_REMOVE -  PRESENCE_UPDATE All events not listed above will be dispatched regardless of whether intents are used or not. This flag type has several additional operations that can be used compared to normal enum types. These are applied to instances of this enum directly, or can be used as a class method by passing the flag as the first parameter. -  def split() -> typing.Sequence[Intents]:  .  Will split the combined flag up into individual atomic flags and return them in a  typing.Sequence .   >>> (FOO | BAR | BAZ).split() [FOO, BAR, BAZ]   -  def has_any( flags: Intents) -> bool:  .  Returns  builtins.True if any of the given flags are present in the combined flag this is applied to. Otherwise, returns  builtins.False instead. -  def has_all( flags: Intents) -> bool:  .  Returns  builtins.True if all of the given flags are present in the combined flag this is applied to. Otherwise, returns  builtins.False instead. -  def has_none( flags: Intents) -> bool:  .  Returns  builtins.True if none of the given flags are present in the combined flag this is applied to. Otherwise, returns  builtins.False instead. In addition, new operators are overloaded.  + will combine flags in the same way  | would usually, and  - will remove specific flags from this instance. This is equivalent to using the  & operator. Finally, combined flag types can be iterated across as if they were a collection.   >>> for f in FOO | BAR | BAZ:  . print(f) FOO BAR BAZ  "

If specified, and  builtins.False , no mentions will be parsed. Alternatively this may be a collection of  hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake , or  hikari.users.PartialUser derivatives to enforce mentioning specific users. role_mentions : hikari.undefined.UndefinedOr[typing.Union[typing.Collection[hikari.snowflakes.SnowflakeishOr[hikari.guilds.PartialRole , builtins.bool If specified, and  builtins.True , all mentions will be parsed. If specified, and  builtins.False , no mentions will be parsed.

Subclasses of  hikari.files.WebResource such as  hikari.files.URL ,  hikari.messages.Attachment ,  hikari.emojis.Emoji ,  EmbedResource , etc will also be uploaded this way. This will use bit-inception, so only a small percentage of the resource will remain in memory at any one time, thus aiding in scalability. - If a  hikari.files.Bytes is passed, or a  builtins.str that contains a valid data URI is passed, then this is uploaded with a randomized file name if not provided. - If a  hikari.files.File ,  pathlib.PurePath or  builtins.str that is an absolute or relative path to a file on your file system is passed, then this resource is uploaded as an attachment using non-blocking code internally and streamed using bit-inception where possible. This depends on the type of  concurrent.futures.Executor that is being used for the application (default is a thread pool which supports this behaviour). Returns    - hikari.messages.Message The created message.

On the other hand,  typing.Optional[float] would mean the value could be a  builtins.float , or the literal  builtins.None value. The reason for using this is in some places, there is a semantic difference between specifying something as being  builtins.None , i.e. \"no value\", and having a default to specify that the value has just not been mentioned. The main example of this is in  edit endpoints where the contents will only be changed if they are explicitly mentioned in the call. Editing a message content and setting it to  builtins.None would be expected to clear the content, whereas setting it to  UNDEFINED would be expected to leave the value as it is without changing it. Consider  UndefinedOr[T] semantically equivalent to  undefined versus  null in JavaScript, or  Optional  versus  null in Java and C .

This exists to allow static type checkers to dereference this value using  typing.Literal , which aids in static type analysis by treating this value as a true singleton. This can only be achieved by using an  enum.Enum of a single value to enforce this. For all other purposes, you can treat this as the type of the  UNDEFINED sentinel in this module.

Other Parameters         allow_color : builtins.bool Defaulting to  builtins.True , this will enable coloured console logs on any platform that is a TTY. Setting a  \"CLICOLOR\" environment variable to any  non  0 value will override this setting. Users should consider this an advice to the application on whether it is safe to show colours if possible or not. Since some terminals can be awkward or not support features in a standard way, the option to explicitly disable this is provided. See  force_color for an alternative. banner : typing.Optional[builtins.str] The package to search for a  banner.txt in. Defaults to  \"hikari\" for the  \"hikari/banner.txt\" banner. Setting this to  builtins.None will disable the banner being shown. chunking_limit : typing.Optional[builtins.int] Defaults to  200 . The maximum amount of requests that this chunker should store information about for each shard. enable_cache : builtins.bool Defaults to  builtins.True . If  builtins.False , the application is configured to be mostly stateless. This means almost all cache calls will yield an empty or  builtins.None value, and you will be left to rely on the  REST API only. This can be a viable alternative if you are providing a custom cache implementation, or simply do not want the overhead of maintaining a state in your application. executor : typing.Optional[concurrent.futures.Executor] Defaults to  builtins.None . If non- builtins.None , then this executor is used instead of the  concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor attached to the  asyncio.AbstractEventLoop that the bot will run on. This executor is used primarily for file-IO. While mainly supporting the  concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor implementation in the standard lib, Hikari's file handling systems should also work with  concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor , which relies on all objects used in IPC to be  pickle able. Many third-party libraries will not support this fully though, so your mileage may vary on using ProcessPoolExecutor implementations with this parameter. force_color : builtins.bool Defaults to  builtins.False . If  builtins.True , then this application will __force__ colour to be used in console-based output. Specifying a  \"CLICOLOR_FORCE\" environment variable with a non- \"0\" value will override this setting. http_settings : typing.Optional[hikari.config.HTTPSettings] Optional custom HTTP configuration settings to use. Allows you to customise functionality such as whether SSL-verification is enabled, what timeouts  aiohttp should expect to use for requests, and behavior regarding HTTP-redirects. intents : typing.Optional[hikari.intents.Intents] Defaults to  hikari.intents.Intents.ALL_UNPRIVILEGED . This allows you to change which intents your application will use on the gateway. This can be used to control and change the types of events you will receive. You can set this to  builtins.None to explicitly disable intents. You will need to enable privileged intents to continue receiving events pertaining to members and member presences from the 7th October 2020. Note that explicitly disabling intents should be treated as deprecated behaviour, and is only supported until Hikari is moved to the v8 Discord API, where this will become mandatory. logs : typing.Union[builtins.None, LoggerLevel, typing.Dict[str, typing.Any Defaults to  \"INFO\" . If  builtins.None , then the Python logging system is left uninitialized on startup, and you will need to configure it manually to view most logs that are output by components of this library. If one of the valid values in a  LoggerLevel , then this will match a call to  colorlog.basicConfig (a facade for  logging.basicConfig with additional conduit for enabling coloured logging levels) with the  level kwarg matching this value. If a  typing.Dict[str, typing.Any] equivalent, then this value is passed to  logging.config.dictConfig to allow the user to provide a specialized logging configuration of their choice. As a side note, you can always opt to leave this on the default value and then use an incremental  logging.config.dictConfig that applies any additional changes on top of the base configuration, if you prefer. An example of this is as follows:  py import os from logging.config import dictConfig from hikari import Bot, Intents bot = Bot(token=os.environ[\"BOT_TOKEN\"], intents=Intents.ALL, logs=\"INFO\")  We want to make gateway logs output as DEBUG, and TRACE for all ratelimit content. dictConfig({ \"version\": 1, \"incremental\": True, \"loggers\": { \"hikari.gateway\": { \"level\": \"DEBUG\" }, \"hikari.ratelimits\": { \"level\": \"TRACE_HIKARI\" }, }, })  Taking note that  \"TRACE_HIKARI\" is a library-specific logging level which is expected to be more verbose than  \"DEBUG\" . proxy_settings : typing.Optional[config.ProxySettings] If specified, custom proxy settings to use with network-layer logic in your application to get through an HTTP-proxy. rest_url : typing.Optional[builtins.str] Defaults to the Discord REST API URL if  builtins.None . Can be overridden if you are attempting to point to an unofficial endpoint, or if you are attempting to mock/stub the Discord API for any reason. Generally you do not want to change this.  ! note  force_color will always take precedence over  allow_color .  ! note Settings that control the gateway session are provided to the  BotApp.run and  BotApp.start functions in this class. This is done to allow you to contextually customise details such as sharding configuration without having to re-initialize the entire application each time."

If  builtins.True , then debugging is enabled for the asyncio event loop in use. check_for_updates : builtins.bool Defaults to  builtins.True . If  builtins.True , will check for newer versions of  hikari on PyPI and notify if available. close_passed_executor : builtins.bool Defaults to  builtins.False . If  builtins.True , any custom  concurrent.futures.Executor passed to the constructor will be shut down when the application terminates. This does not affect the default executor associated with the event loop, and will not do anything if you do not provide a custom executor to the constructor. close_loop : builtins.bool Defaults to  builtins.True . If  builtins.True , then once the bot enters a state where all components have shut down permanently during application shutdown, then all asyngens and background tasks will be destroyed, and the event loop will be shut down. This will wait until all  hikari -owned  aiohttp connectors have had time to attempt to shut down correctly (around 250ms), and on Python 3.9 and newer, will also shut down the default event loop executor too. coroutine_tracking_depth : typing.Optional[builtins.int] Defaults to  builtins.None . If an integer value and supported by the interpreter, then this many nested coroutine calls will be tracked with their call origin state. This allows you to determine where non-awaited coroutines may originate from, but generally you do not want to leave this enabled for performance reasons. enable_signal_handlers : builtins.bool Defaults to  builtins.True . If on a __non-Windows__ OS with builtin support for kernel-level POSIX signals, then setting this to  builtins.True will allow treating keyboard interrupts and other OS signals to safely shut down the application as calls to shut down the application properly rather than just killing the process in a dirty state immediately.

If  builtins.False , then attempting to start more sessions than you are allowed in a 24 hour window will throw a  hikari.errors.GatewayError rather than going ahead and hitting the IDENTIFY limit, which may result in your token being reset. Setting to  builtins.True disables this behavior. large_threshold : builtins.int Threshold for members in a guild before it is treated as being \"large\" and no longer sending member details in the  GUILD CREATE event. Defaults to  250 . propagate_interrupts : builtins.bool Defaults to  builtins.False . If set to  builtins.True , then any internal  hikari.errors.HikariInterrupt that is raises as a result of catching an OS level signal will result in the exception being rethrown once the application has closed. This can allow you to use hikari signal handlers and still be able to determine what kind of interrupt the application received after it closes. When  builtins.False , nothing is raised and the call will terminate cleanly and silently where possible instead. shard_ids : typing.Optional[typing.Set[builtins.int The shard IDs to create shards for. If not  builtins.None , then a non- None  shard_count must ALSO be provided.

"doc":"Rate-limit extensions for RESTful bucketed endpoints. Provides implementations for the complex rate limiting mechanisms that Discord requires for rate limit handling that conforms to the passed bucket headers correctly. This was initially a bit of a headache for me to understand, personally, since there is a lot of \"implicit detail\" that is easy to miss from the documentation. In an attempt to make this somewhat understandable by anyone else, I have tried to document the theory of how this is handled here. What is the theory behind this implementation?                        In this module, we refer to a  hikari.utilities.routes.CompiledRoute as a definition of a route with specific major parameter values included (e.g.  POST /channels/123/messages ), and a  hikari.utilities.routes.Route as a definition of a route without specific parameter values included (e.g.  POST /channels/{channel}/messages ). We can compile a  hikari.utilities.routes.CompiledRoute from a  hikari.utilities.routes.Route by providing the corresponding parameters as kwargs, as you may already know. In this module, a \"bucket\" is an internal data structure that tracks and enforces the rate limit state for a specific  hikari.utilities.routes.CompiledRoute , and can manage delaying tasks in the event that we begin to get rate limited. It also supports providing in-order execution of queued tasks. Discord allocates types of buckets to routes. If you are making a request and there is a valid rate limit on the route you hit, you should receive an  X-RateLimit-Bucket header from the server in your response. This is a hash that identifies a route based on internal criteria that does not include major parameters. This  X-RateLimitBucket is known in this module as an \"bucket hash\". This means that generally, the route  POST /channels/123/messages and  POST /channels/456/messages will usually sit in the same bucket, but  GET /channels/123/messages/789 and  PATCH /channels/123/messages/789 will usually not share the same bucket. Discord may or may not change this at any time, so hard coding this logic is not a useful thing to be doing. Rate limits, on the other hand, apply to a bucket and are specific to the major parameters of the compiled route. This means that  POST /channels/123/messages and  POST /channels/456/messages do not share the same real bucket, despite Discord providing the same bucket hash. A real bucket hash is the  builtins.str hash of the bucket that Discord sends us in a response concatenated to the corresponding major parameters. This is used for quick bucket indexing internally in this module. One issue that occurs from this is that we cannot effectively hash a  hikari.utilities.routes.CompiledRoute that has not yet been hit, meaning that until we receive a response from this endpoint, we have no idea what our rate limits could be, nor the bucket that they sit in. This is usually not problematic, as the first request to an endpoint should never be rate limited unless you are hitting it from elsewhere in the same time window outside your hikari.applications. To manage this situation, unknown endpoints are allocated to a special unlimited bucket until they have an initial bucket hash code allocated from a response. Once this happens, the route is reallocated a dedicated bucket. Unknown buckets have a hardcoded initial hash code internally. Initially acquiring time on a bucket                   Each time you  BaseRateLimiter.acquire() a request timeslice for a given  hikari.utilities.routes.Route , several things happen. The first is that we attempt to find the existing bucket for that route, if there is one, or get an unknown bucket otherwise. This is done by creating a real bucket hash from the compiled route. The initial hash is calculated using a lookup table that maps  hikari.utilities.routes.CompiledRoute objects to their corresponding initial hash codes, or to the unknown bucket hash code if not yet known. This initial hash is processed by the  hikari.utilities.routes.CompiledRoute to provide the real bucket hash we need to get the route's bucket object internally. The  BaseRateLimiter.acquire() method will take the bucket and acquire a new timeslice on it. This takes the form of a  asyncio.Future which should be awaited by the caller and will complete once the caller is allowed to make a request. Most of the time, this is done instantly, but if the bucket has an active rate limit preventing requests being sent, then the future will be paused until the rate limit is over. This may be longer than the rate limit period if you have queued a large number of requests during this limit, as it is first-come-first-served. Acquiring a rate limited bucket will start a bucket-wide task (if not already running) that will wait until the rate limit has completed before allowing more futures to complete. This is done while observing the rate limits again, so can easily begin to re-ratelimit itself if needed. Once the task is complete, it tidies itself up and disposes of itself. This task will complete once the queue becomes empty. The result of  RESTBucketManager.acquire() is a tuple of a  asyncio.Future to await on which completes when you are allowed to proceed with making a request, and a real bucket hash which should be stored temporarily. This will be explained in the next section. When you make your response, you should be sure to set the  X-RateLimit-Precision header to  millisecond to ensure a much greater accuracy against rounding errors for rate limits (reduces the error margin from  1 second to  1 millisecond). Handling the rate limit headers of a response                       - Once you have received your response, you are expected to extract the values of the vital rate limit headers manually and parse them to the correct data types. These headers are:   Date : the response date on the server. This should be parsed to a  datetime.datetime using  email.utils.parsedate_to_datetime .   X-RateLimit-Limit : an  builtins.int describing the max requests in the bucket from empty to being rate limited.   X-RateLimit-Remaining : an  builtins.int describing the remaining number of requests before rate limiting occurs in the current window.   X-RateLimit-Bucket : a  builtins.str containing the initial bucket hash.   X-RateLimit-Reset : a  builtins.float containing the number of seconds since 1st January 1970 at 0:00:00 UTC at which the current ratelimit window resets. This should be parsed to a  datetime.datetime using  datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp , passing  datetime.timezone.utc as  tz . Each of the above values should be passed to the  update_rate_limits method to ensure that the bucket you acquired time from is correctly updated should Discord decide to alter their ratelimits on the fly without warning (including timings and the bucket). This method will manage creating new buckets as needed and resetting vital information in each bucket you use. Tidying up      To prevent unused buckets cluttering up memory, each  RESTBucketManager instance spins up a  asyncio.Task that periodically locks the bucket list (not threadsafe, only using the concept of asyncio not yielding in regular functions) and disposes of any clearly stale buckets that are no longer needed. These will be recreated again in the future if they are needed. When shutting down an application, one must remember to  close() the  RESTBucketManager that has been used. This will ensure the garbage collection task is stopped, and will also ensure any remaining futures in any bucket queues have an  asyncio.CancelledError set on them to prevent deadlocking ratelimited calls that may be waiting to be unlocked. Body-field-specific rate limiting                 - As of the start of June, 2020, Discord appears to be enforcing another layer of rate limiting logic to their HTTP APIs which is field-specific. This means that special rate limits will also exist on some endpoints that limit based on what attributes you send in a JSON or form data payload. No information is sent in headers about these specific limits. You will only be made aware that they exist once you get ratelimited. In the 429 ratelimited response, you will have the  \"global\" attribute set to  builtins.False , and a  \"reset_after\" attribute that differs entirely to the  X-RateLimit-Reset header. Thus, it is important to not assume the value in the 429 response for the reset time is the same as the one in the bucket headers. Hikari's  hikari.api.rest.RESTClient implementation specifically uses the value furthest in the future when working out which bucket to adhere to. It is worth remembering that there is an API limit to the number of 401s, 403s, and 429s you receive, which is around 10,000 per 15 minutes. Passing this limit results in a soft ban of your account. At the time of writing, the only example of this appears to be on the  PATCH /channels/{channel_id} endpoint. This has a limit of two changes per 10 minutes. More details about how this is implemented have yet to be released or documented . Caveats    - These implementations rely on Discord sending consistent buckets back to us. This also begins to crumble if more than one HTTP client is in use, since there is no performent way to communicate shared rate limits between distributed applications. The general concept to follow is that if you are making repeated API calls, or calls that are not event-based (e.g. fetching messages on a timer), then this can be considered a form of API abuse and should be used sparingly."

This is somewhat similar to the  WindowedBurstRateLimiter in how it works. This algorithm will use fixed-period time windows that have a given limit (capacity). Each time a task requests processing time, it will drip another unit into the bucket.

If left as  None (the default), then the first matching event type that the bot receives (or any subtype) will be the one returned.  ! warn ASYNC PREDICATES ARE NOT SUPPORTED. timeout : typing.Union[builtins.float, builtins.int, builtins.None] The amount of time to wait before raising an  asyncio.TimeoutError and giving up instead. This is measured in seconds. If  builtins.None , then no timeout will be waited for (no timeout can result in \"leaking\" of coroutines that never complete if called in an uncontrolled way, so is not recommended). Returns    - hikari.events.base_events.Event The event that was provided.

The purpose of this is to provide an interface to lazily deserialize collections of payloads received from paginated API endpoints such as  GET /channels/{channel_id}/messages , which will return a certain number of messages at a time on a low level. This class provides the base interface for handling lazily decoding each item in those responses and returning them in the expected format when iterating across this object. Implementations are expected to provide a  _next_chunk private method which when awaited returns a lazy generator of each deserialized object to later yield. This will be iterated across lazily by this implementation, thus reducing the amount of work needed if only a few objects out of, say, 100, need to be deserialized. This  _next_chunk should return  builtins.None once the end of all items has been reached. An example would look like the following:   async def some_http_call(i):  . class SomeEndpointLazyIterator(BufferedLazyIterator[SomeObject]): def __init__(self): super().__init__() self._i = 0 def _next_chunk(self) -> typing.Optional[typing.Generator[ValueT, None, None : raw_items = await some_http_call(self._i) self._i += 1 if not raw_items: return None generator = (SomeObject(raw_item) for raw_item in raw_items) return generator  "
